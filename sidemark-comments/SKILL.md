  Read, add, reply to, resolve, and act on comments and edit suggestions stored
  in Sidemark / MRSF sidecar files — a `<note>.md.review.yaml` file next to a
  Markdown note, as written by the Sidemark Obsidian plugin, the Sidemark VS
  Code extension, and the `mrsf` CLI. Use whenever a note has a
  `.review.yaml` sidecar, when a user asks to comment on, annotate, review, or
  suggest edits to a note that uses Sidemark, or when a user asks to reply to,
  resolve, accept, or decline a Sidemark comment or suggestion. For notes that
  carry a `tandem-comments` block and no sidecar, use obsidian-tandem-comments
  instead.

# Sidemark comments: MRSF review sidecars

Sidemark keeps a note's comments **out of the note**. They live in a sidecar
file beside it: `Projects/Plan.md` has its comments in
`Projects/Plan.md.review.yaml` (the full note filename plus `.review.yaml`).
The format is [MRSF v1.0](https://github.com/wictorwilen/MRSF) with a few
Sidemark extension fields. **Commenting never touches the note.** The only
time the note changes is when a suggestion is accepted.

Sidemark watches both files, so anything written to the sidecar shows up in
Obsidian's editor and sidebar immediately.

## Which skill applies

- A note with a `.review.yaml` sidecar, or a vault that uses Sidemark: this
  skill.
- A note with a ```` ```tandem-comments ```` block at the end and no sidecar:
  obsidian-tandem-comments. Don't convert it yourself. Sidemark's settings
  have a conversion button (and a command) that turns every Tandem block into
  a sidecar, and the user runs it.
- Asked to comment on a note that has neither: ask which format they want
  unless the vault already has `.review.yaml` files, in which case use
  Sidemark.

## The file

```

Top level: `mrsf_version` (`"1.0"`, quoted), `document` (the note's path
relative to the vault root), `comments` (a flat list; threads are formed by
`reply_to`).

### Fields on each comment

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Required. Unique and opaque. Sidemark writes a random UUID; do the same. |
| `author` | Required. Display name. MRSF recommends `Display Name (identifier)`; in practice match what's already in the vault (see Authoring). |
| `timestamp` | Required. ISO 8601 with a timezone, e.g. `2026-09-17T16:40:00.000Z`. Take it from `date`, never from memory. |
| `text` | Required. The comment. Sidemark renders it as Markdown, so `[[wikilinks]]` work. Empty on a suggestion that has no explanation. |
| `resolved` | Required boolean. |
| `reply_to` | On a reply: the `id` of the comment it answers. Replies carry no position fields. |
| `line`, `end_line` | 1-based line numbers, `end_line` inclusive. Counted over the raw file, **including frontmatter**. |
| `start_column`, `end_column` | 0-based offsets within `line` and `end_line`. `end_column` is exclusive: `"The quick brown"` → `quick brown` is `start_column: 4`, `end_column: 15`. Counted in UTF-16 code units (JavaScript string indices), so an emoji counts as 2. |
| `selected_text` | The exact text the reviewer selected. **Never change it** after creation; it's the original quote, used to find the passage again. |
| `selected_text_hash` | Lowercase hex SHA-256 of `selected_text`. Sidemark writes it on new comments. |
| `anchored_text` | What the passage reads *now*, when it no longer matches `selected_text` (the text was edited). Written by Sidemark and `mrsf reanchor`; leave it alone. |
| `type`, `severity` | Optional MRSF categories. `type: suggestion` marks an edit suggestion. |
| `commit` | Optional git SHA stamped by the `mrsf` CLI. Harmless; leave it. |

### Sidemark's extension fields

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `x_prefix` / `x_suffix` | Up to 20 characters immediately before and after the quote (fewer at the start or end of the file; they may cross line breaks). They tell identical quotes apart, like a W3C TextQuoteSelector's `prefix`/`suffix`. |
| `x_suggestion` | `{ replacement, result? }` on a root comment with `type: suggestion`. `replacement` is the proposed text; an **empty `replacement` proposes deleting** the passage. `result` is `accepted` or `declined` once decided. The root's `text` is the optional explanation. |
| `x_tandem_id` | The original id of a comment converted from Tandem Comments. |
| `x_reanchor_status`, `x_reanchor_score` | Written by `mrsf reanchor`. Leave them. |

Keep every field you don't recognize. Other MRSF tools write their own
`x_*` fields.

### Sidemark's conventions

- **A thread** is a root (no `reply_to`) plus every comment whose `reply_to`
  chain leads back to it. The sidebar shows replies oldest first.
- **Resolving a thread resolves its replies too**: set `resolved: true` on the
  root and on every reply. Reopening sets them all back to `false`.
- **A suggestion with a `result` counts as resolved**, even if `resolved` is
  still false.
- **A root with neither `line` nor `selected_text` shows as orphaned** in
  Sidemark. MRSF allows document-level comments, but Sidemark has nowhere to
  put them, so always anchor a root comment to a passage.
- **Deleting a thread's root deletes the whole thread.** Deleting a reply
  re-attaches its own replies to its parent (MRSF §9.1).

## Reading comments

1. Read the note and its sidecar.
2. Build the threads from `reply_to`.
3. Find each root's passage: look for `selected_text` in the note; when it
   occurs more than once, pick the occurrence whose surrounding text matches
   `x_prefix`/`x_suffix`, then the one at `line`/`start_column`. If
   `anchored_text` is present, the passage was edited since the comment and
   now reads `anchored_text`. If neither is found, the comment is orphaned;
   say so rather than guessing at a location.
4. Skip resolved threads unless asked about them.

When summarizing for the user, quote the passage, then the thread.

## Writing to the sidecar

**Edit the YAML in place.** Sidemark and the `mrsf` tools both preserve
formatting and YAML comments in the parts of a sidecar they don't change, and
a hand-edited sidecar should get the same care: add or change only the
entries involved, and leave everything else byte for byte.

- **Never write a sidecar you couldn't parse.** If the file isn't valid YAML
  or isn't shaped like the example above, stop and tell the user what's
  wrong. Sidemark itself refuses to overwrite such a file.
- **Creating a sidecar**: when the note has none, create it with
  `mrsf_version: "1.0"`, `document: <note path from the vault root>`, and the
  new comment in `comments`.
- **Quote strings YAML would misread**: text starting with a special
  character, containing `: ` or ` #`, or that looks like a number, boolean,
  or date. When in doubt, double-quote it.
- **In an Obsidian vault, go through the vault tools** you'd use for any other
  vault file (for example the Obsidian MCP server's read and write tools),
  unless you've been told the vault may be written to directly on disk.
- **The `mrsf` CLI** (`npx @mrsf/cli`) is the other route when the vault is
  on local disk. Run it **from the vault root** so `document` paths match:

  ```sh
  npx @mrsf/cli list --json --open "Projects/Plan.md"
  npx @mrsf/cli add "Projects/Plan.md" -a "Claude" -t "Consider a table here" \
    -l 12 --start-column 4 --end-column 21 --selected-text "the three options"
  npx @mrsf/cli add "Projects/Plan.md" -a "Claude" -t "Done." --reply-to <id>
  npx @mrsf/cli resolve --cascade "Projects/Plan.md.review.yaml" <id>
  npx @mrsf/cli validate "Projects/Plan.md.review.yaml"
  ```

  Its gaps, as of `@mrsf/cli` 0.7.1:

  - **Always pass `--selected-text`.** Without it, `add` fills
    `selected_text` from the line *above* the one given (an off-by-one in
    `populateSelectedText`), and on line 1 it fills nothing. Passing it
    skips `selected_text_hash`; that field is optional, so add it by hand
    only if you want parity with Sidemark.
  - It doesn't write `x_prefix`/`x_suffix`. Add them by hand after `add`
    when the quote isn't unique in the note.
  - A sidecar it *creates* gets `document: Plan.md` (the bare filename).
    Change it to the vault-relative path. Sidemark also corrects it the next
    time it saves that sidecar.
  - `resolve --cascade` reaches only *direct* replies, and `resolve --undo`
    reopens only the one comment. Set `resolved` on the rest of the thread
    by hand.
  - It has no notion of `x_suggestion`. Write suggestions by hand, or with
    `--type suggestion --ext 'x_suggestion={"replacement":"…"}'`.

## Authoring

- **Author name**: use the name the user asks for. Otherwise use `Claude`,
  unless the vault's sidecars already show a convention for AI authors;
  follow that.
- **New comment** on a passage: compute `line`, `end_line`, `start_column`,
  `end_column` from the note's raw text (frontmatter included), set
  `selected_text` to the exact passage, `selected_text_hash` to its SHA-256,
  and `x_prefix`/`x_suffix` to up to 20 characters around it. Add
  `id`, `author`, `timestamp`, `text`, `resolved: false`. Double-check the
  columns by slicing: the note's text at that range must equal
  `selected_text` exactly.
- **Reply**: `id`, `author`, `timestamp`, `text`, `resolved: false`,
  `reply_to: <id of the comment answered>`. No position fields. Append it to
  the end of `comments`.
- **Suggestion**: a new root comment, anchored as above, with
  `type: suggestion`, `x_suggestion: { replacement: <proposed text> }`, and
  the reason in `text` (or `text: ""`). Use `replacement: ""` to propose a
  deletion. **Don't edit the note** when suggesting.
- Keep comments short and specific. One concern per thread.

## Acting on comments

- **Resolve** only when asked (or when the user's instructions say to resolve
  what you've addressed): set `resolved: true` on the root and all its
  replies. Don't delete resolved threads; Sidemark keeps them as history and
  has its own command to remove them. Only delete a thread when the user
  asks.
- **Reopen**: set `resolved: false` on the root and its replies; on a
  suggestion, also remove `x_suggestion.result`.
- **Accept a suggestion** only when the user asks:
  1. Find the passage (as in Reading comments). Refuse if it's orphaned or
     ambiguous, or if the note's text there no longer equals the text the
     suggestion was made against (`anchored_text` if present, otherwise
     `selected_text`); tell the user instead.
  2. Replace exactly that range in the note with `x_suggestion.replacement`.
  3. In the sidecar, set `x_suggestion.result: accepted` and
     `resolved: true` on the root and its replies. If the user's Sidemark
     setting is to remove resolved threads (`resolveBehavior: remove` in the
     vault's `.obsidian/plugins/sidemark/data.json`), delete the thread
     instead.
  4. Other open comments whose passages moved are re-anchored by Sidemark the
     next time the note is open; you don't need to recompute their positions.
     If Obsidian isn't running, `npx @mrsf/cli reanchor "<note>"` does the
     same.
- **Decline a suggestion**: leave the note alone; set
  `x_suggestion.result: declined` and resolve the thread (or delete it, under
  `resolveBehavior: remove`).
- **Addressing a comment by editing the note** (the user asked you to act on
  the feedback): make the edit, reply in the thread saying what changed, and
  resolve it only if asked to.
